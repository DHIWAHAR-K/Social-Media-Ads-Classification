# Social Media Ads Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying social media ads using machine learning techniques in Python. Leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, the project analyzes features related to social media ads and trains a classification model. The goal is to categorize ads into relevant classes, aiding marketers in understanding ad performance and targeting strategies.

## Project Structure

- `social_media_ads_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for building classification models.
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization library.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Running the Project
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook social_media_ads_classification.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.
Make sure to have the ads_data.csv file in the same directory as the notebook.
Follow the notebook steps for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Ads Classification Model
A machine learning model is trained on features related to social media ads to classify them into relevant classes.
Evaluation metrics are provided to assess the model's performance in classifying ads.

## Customization
Modify the dataset or experiment with different machine learning algorithms for improved classification accuracy.
Explore additional features or optimizations to enhance the ads classification model.
