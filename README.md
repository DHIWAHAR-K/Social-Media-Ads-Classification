# Social-Media-Ads-Classification
Social Media Ads Classification with advance python

the dataset is already imported in the code since it was online
download the code file and run it using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code(if you have the right extensions installed)


For themes VS Code themes I would recommend "Synthwave84"....
